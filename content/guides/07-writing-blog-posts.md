Sprinthub blog posts are written by people from all over the company, not just those with “writer” or "marketer" in their job titles. We love having experts from around the company blog about their work. The person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it, and the writers on the marketing team can help with brainstorming and editing as needed.

We have two Sprinthub blogs, the one written by our [engineering](http://medium.com/sprinthub/) for engineers. This section will focus on the main [Sprinthub blog](http://sprinthubmobile.com/blog), but the guidelines apply to the other channels, too.

## Basics

We update the main Sprinthub blog a couple times every week. We generally publish:

- How tos, guides, checklists, templates and insights
- Sprinthub customer case studies
- Tips and tricks for businesses

We publish blog posts that explain the “why” behind the work we do at Sprinthub. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with expertise and the best process, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind the work we do.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone]({{< ref "guides/02-voice-and-tone.md" >}}) and [Grammar and mechanics]({{< ref "guides/04-grammar-and-mechanics.md" >}}) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart

This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific

If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a Sprinthub customer, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, market, results, and values.

### Get to the point

Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our audience are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up

Feel free to link away from Sprinthub's existing content if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL

Sprinthub is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Use tags and keywords

In WordPress, add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures

Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use Sprinthub, include screenshots to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
